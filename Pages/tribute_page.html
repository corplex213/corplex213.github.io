          Soldier, chemist, musician, war strategist, journalist, pharmacist, and hot-headed general, Antonio Luna was a complex man who was, unfortunately, perceived as a threat by 
          the Philippines' ruthless first president <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emilio_Aguinaldo" target="_blank">
          Emilio Aguinaldo</a> and as a result died not on the battlefields of the Philippine-American War but on the streets of Cabanatuan.

        <h2 id="headline">EARLY LIFE OF A REVOLUTIONARY</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>October 29, 1866</strong> - Antonio Luna de San Pedro y Novicio-Ancheta was born in the Binondo district of Manila, 
            the seventh child of Laureana Novicio-Ancheta, a Spanish mestiza, and Joaquin Luna de San Pedro, a traveling salesman.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>1881</strong> - Antonio was a gifted student who studied with a teacher called Maestro Intong from the age of six and received a Bachelor of Arts from the Ateneo
             Municipal de Manila before continuing his studies in chemistry, music, and literature at the University of Santo Tomas.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1890</strong> - Antonio traveled to Spain to join his brother Juan, who was studying painting in Madrid. 
            There, Antonio earned a licentiate in pharmacy at the Universidad de Barcelona, followed by a doctorate from the Universidad Central de Madrid.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>1894</strong> - He went on to study bacteriology and histology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris and continuing on to Belgium to further those pursuits. 
            While in Spain, Luna had published a well-received paper on malaria, so the Spanish government appointed him to a post as a specialist in communicable and tropical 
            diseases.
          </li>

        <h2 id="headline">SWEPT INTO THE REVOLUTION</h2>
        
        <li>As the Spanish/American War came to a close, and the defeated Spanish prepared to withdraw from the Philippines, Filipino revolutionary troops surrounded the capital city 
          of Manila. The newly-arrived officer Antonio Luna urged the other commanders to send troops into the city to ensure a joint occupation when the 
          Americans arrived, but Emilio Aguinaldo refused, believing U.S. naval officers stationed in Manila Bay would hand over power to the Filipinos in due course. </li>
       
        <li>
          <strong>1898</strong> - Luna complained bitterly about this strategic blunder, as well as the disorderly conduct of American troops once they landed in Manila in mid-August. 
          To placate Luna, Aguinaldo promoted him to the rank of Brigadier General on September 26, and named him Chief of War Operations.
        </li>

        <li>
          General Luna continued to campaign for better military discipline, organization and approach to Americans, who were now setting themselves up as the new colonial rulers. 
          Along with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apolinario_Mabini" taget="_blank">Apolinario Mabini</a>, Antonio Luna warned Aguinaldo that the Americans did not seem inclined to free the Philippines.
        </li>

        <h2 id="headline">AN UNEXPECTED DEATH</h2>
        
        <li>On June 5, Luna went alone to the government headquarters to speak with President Aguinaldo, but was met with one of his old enemies there instead — a man he had once disarmed for cowardice, 
          who informed him that the meeting was canceled and Aguinaldo was out of town. Furious, Luna had started to walk back down the stairs when a rifle shot went off outside. </li>
        <li>
          Luna ran down the stairs, where he met one of the Cavite officers he had dismissed for insubordination. The officer struck Luna on the head with his bolo and soon Cavite
           troops swarmed the injured general, stabbing him. Luna drew his revolver and fired, but he missed his attackers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Still, he fought his way out to the plaza, where Roman and Rusca ran to help him, but Roman was shot to death and Rusca was severely injured. He died at 32 years old.
        </li>
        <li>
          Abandoned and alone, Luna sank bleeding to the cobblestones of the plaza where he uttered his last words: "Cowards! Assassins!" He died at 32 years old.
        </li>
        </ul>
          <p>
            "May mas malaki tayong kalaban sa mga Amerikano–ang ating sarili, mas magandang mamatay sa digmaan kaysa magpasakop sa dayuhan. Madali pang pagkasunduin ang langit at lupa 
            kaysa dalawang Pilipino tungkol sa kahit na anong bagay. Ganito ba talaga ang tadhana natin?
            Kalaban ng kalaban, Kalaban ng kakampi, nakakapagod. Mas mahalaga ang papel natin sa digmaan kaysa sa anumang nararamdaman natin sa isa’t isa."
