            Web application development stands at the forefront of modern technological innovation, shaping the digital landscape in profound ways. As graduating from this course delving into the intricacies of this field, 
            I find myself reflecting on the journey thus far, contemplating the evolution, challenges, and future prospects of web application development.
          </p>

          <p>
            The evolution of web application development traces a narrative of relentless innovation and adaptation. From the rudimentary HTML pages of the early internet to the sophisticated, 
            immersive applications of today, the trajectory has been propelled by a relentless quest for improvement, driven by advancements in technology, shifts in user expectations, and the dynamic landscape of the digital economy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, beneath the surface of technological progress lies a rich tapestry of human experience and endeavor. Web application development is not merely about lines of code or algorithms; it is a manifestation of human creativity, collaboration, and ingenuity. It is a discipline that bridges 
            the gap between art and science, where aesthetic design meets functional utility, and where user experience takes precedence over mere functionality.

          CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used to style the presentation of HTML documents. While HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS allows you to control how that content is displayed on the screen.
          With CSS, you can define styles for various elements of your HTML document, such as fonts, colors, spacing, layout, and more. By separating the content from its presentation, CSS promotes cleaner code, easier maintenance, and greater flexibility in design.

        <h2>Types of CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Inline CSS <br> - Inline CSS is applied directly to HTML elements using the style attribute. <br> - Styles defined inline override any external or internal CSS rules.</li>
          <li>Internal CSS <br> - Internal CSS is placed within the "style" element in the "head" section of an HTML document. <br> - Styles defined internally apply to the entire document.</li>
          <li>External CSS <br> - External CSS is stored in separate CSS files and linked to HTML documents using the "link" element. <br> - Allows for better organization and reusability of styles across multiple pages.</li>
